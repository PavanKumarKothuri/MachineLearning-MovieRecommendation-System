## 🎯 Problem Statement  
In today's OTT landscape, **users struggle to find relevant movies** among thousands of options. A lack of personalization leads to:  
❌ **Poor User Engagement** – Users leave the platform due to irrelevant recommendations.  
❌ **Low Watch Time** – Bad suggestions mean fewer hours spent watching content.  
❌ **Revenue Loss** – Subscription-based platforms lose paying users.  

### ✅ Our AI-Powered Solution  
✔ **Content-Based Filtering** – Recommends movies based on similarity in genres & descriptions.  
✔ **Collaborative Filtering** – Leverages user ratings & interactions to suggest relevant movies.  
✔ **Hybrid Model** – Combines both approaches for highly accurate recommendations.

## 🛠️ Tech Implementation  
### **1️⃣ Data Processing & Feature Engineering**  
📂 **Dataset** – Uses **IMDB & MovieLens** datasets with `title`, `genres`, `ratings`.  
📝 **Preprocessing** – Cleans data, fills missing values & vectorizes movie descriptions.  

### **2️⃣ Building the Recommendation Engine**  
🔍 **Content-Based Filtering** – Uses **TF-IDF Vectorization + Cosine Similarity**.  
👥 **Collaborative Filtering** – Uses **User-Item Interaction Matrix + Matrix Factorization**.  
⚡ **Hybrid Model** – Combines both filtering methods for higher accuracy.  

### **3️⃣ Deployment on AWS**  
🚀 **Backend:** Deployed as a Python API using **FastAPI**.  
💻 **Frontend:** Interactive UI built using **Streamlit**.  
☁️ **Cloud Hosting:** Deployed on **AWS EC2 + S3** for scalability.
